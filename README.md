# Ethical_Hacking_Scanning_Networks

Module 3, Scanning Networks, contains guides and resources for using tools like Nmap, Wireshark, Unicornscan, and Angry IP Scanner to perform host discovery, port scanning, 

OS detection, and packet analysis for the CY201 course at GIKI.

# Repository Structure

Guides for tools like Nmap, Wireshark, Unicornscan, and Angry IP Scanner for network scanning and analysis.

Focused on host discovery, port/service scanning, OS detection, and packet capture for network reconnaissance.

# Report

Documents network scanning techniques, including host discovery, port scanning, OS detection, and packet analysis results.

Refer to the report for detailed findings and analysis from Module 3 activities.

# Screenshots

Captures tool outputs like Nmap scan results, Wireshark packet captures, Unicornscan port details, and Angry IP Scanner host lists.

Visuals demonstrate the results of network scanning activities for clarity.

# Tools Used

Lists tools (e.g., Nmap v7.94, Wireshark v4.4.6, Unicornscan v1.10.3, Angry IP Scanner v3.9.1) for network scanning tasks.

Download tools from official repositories (e.g., Nmap, Wireshark websites) or contact me for tool files.

# Commands Used

Includes commands for Nmap (nmap -A, nmap -O, nmap -sn -PE), Unicornscan (unicornscan -Iv), ping, and ipconfig/ip a for network scanning.

Covers setup and scanning commands for targets like 192.168.216.214 and 192.168.216.219.

# VirtualBox Oracle VM

Guides for setting up and configuring VirtualBox Oracle VM to run tools like Nmap and Unicornscan on Parrot Security OS and Windows VMs.

Configure settings as per lab requirements for network scanning on VMs like Windows Server 2019 and Parrot OS 2.
